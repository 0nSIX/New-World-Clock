# New-World-Clock
Simple clock as a standalone window app that will display time and date while in-game. This was tailored for anyone with a single monitor or multiple monitors that hides the default clock in their taskbar. \\ This does not read any API's from Amazon's New World, therefore does not break any ToS.
