# New-World-Clock
Simple clock as a standalone window app that will display time and date while in-game. This was tailored for anyone with a single monitor or multiple monitors that hides the default clock in their taskbar. This can also be used in other games or applications that utilizes full screen and does not show the Windows Taskbar with your clock on it.
